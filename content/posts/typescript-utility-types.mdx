In this post, Let's talk about utility types in Typescript, what exactly are they anyway?. Utility types are a set of generic types provided by TypeScript that perform certain operations on types

Aight, here are some utility types that are commonly used in Typescript:

## Partial`<Type>`

What this does is it converts all properties of a type to be optional. This is useful when you want to update only a few properties of an object.

```ts
interface Order {
  id: number;
  orderName: string;
  price: number;
}

type PartialOrder = Partial<Order>;

// All properties in PartialOrder are optional
const updateUser: PartialOrder = { orderName:"Ducati Panigale v4" };
```
